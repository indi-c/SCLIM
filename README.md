# SCLIM
### Simple Command Line Interface Menus

#### Function

This, as my first project in C, is intended to primarily be an implementation of the STATE pattern while providing basic CLI menu functionality.

Everything is stored as a state, which means you can do a lot with this library as the functionality is still up to you to write while leaving the background of setting up everything to the library.

Uses the raw mode for linux terminals and reads one character at a time for input.
